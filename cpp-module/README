To compile this code, create the following directories:

build/
lib/
scons/

Now place an up-to-date installation of scons in the corresponding folder, such 
that the main scons script is located at:

scons/bin/scons

Type 'make compile' to start the build-process and 'make test' to compile and 
run the tests. Run 'make checkstyle' to parse the code with cpplint.py. In case
the build fails because of missing libraries, place them under lib/
